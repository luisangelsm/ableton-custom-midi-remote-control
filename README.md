# ableton-custom-midi-remote-control

This repo is based on [Generic-Python-Remote-Script](https://github.com/luisangelsm/Generic-Python-Remote-Script)

Install it by copying all the python files in a folder called MocoLUFA and then place the folder in `\ProgramData\Ableton\Live x.x\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\` or `/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/` depending if you are in Windows or mac.

It supports Ableton Live 11 and can toggle the session record button. Edit `MIDI_Map.py` to customize it.

I use it to control Ableton from a pedal board I built using arduino.
